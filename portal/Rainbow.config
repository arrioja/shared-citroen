	<!-- Rainbow Support Functionality - Error Handler V0.8 -->
	<!-- 
		Select which ways you wish errors to be logged.
		
		Many thanks to Joan M who provided the original code. 
		This Error System was Modified and Extended by John Mandia.
		
		For Event Log, You need special permissions to create an Event Log Source. 
		If you have not created an Event Log Source yourself or the account this app uses doesn't
		have special rights, I recommmend keeping SuppportEventLogSource as "Application" since
		it already exists on Servers and shouldn't cause any problems.
		  
		LogToEventLog  - This logs errors as Application on the server. Set to either true or false.
        LogToFile      - This logs errors to a text file. Set to either true or false.
        LogToEmail     - This logs errors to email and sends them to the "SupportEmailAddress" address.
		
		This functionality could be extended to include other logging techniques. 
		Log to:
		
		LogToXml          - Would log to an Xml File
		LogToDB           - Would log to a Database
		LogToWebService   - Would log to a WebService e.g. If you're an agency and you want to be able to keep track of your deployed sites this could be an option 
		 
		AlternateLogLocation:
		
		Only change it to something if you wish to specify a different default location e.g C:\MyRainbowErrors\ 
		The "LogToFile" with the errors will be placed here. This also specifies where other logs will be located  e.g LogToXml.
		Either in the default /rb_logs/ Folder or one of your choosing. 
		
		Please ensure you have added write permissions to this location otherwise it will not create the error logs.

		LogFileFormat
		
		This setting can be used by all Error Loggers also. It lets you specify whether you want your errors logged by day,month or year.
		It has three settings:
		
		Daily           -  Errors are grouped by day. E.g of the File Logger: error_log_2003-4-9.txt 
		Monthly         -  Errors are grouped by month. E.g of the File Logger: error_log_2003-4.txt
		Yearly          -  Errors are grouped by year. E.g of the File Loggers: error_log_2003.txt
		
		If this setting is left blank or does not match any of the above keys, then the filename will default to error_log.txt

		Zen relies heavily on browsers being forced into "Standards Compliance mode" in order
		to ensure consistent, predictable behaviour and the same results on all browser types.
		You can set the DOCTYPE string in Site Settings... but if it is left blank (the default)
		then Zen pages will exhibit problems. If the Site Setting is left blank then the setting 
		below will be used as the default for any pages with a Zen Theme. 
		See http://gutfeldt.ch/matthias/articles/doctypeswitch/table.html (and many other

        This is clear if you try to add a new tab or a new module.
