Module settings
---------------
VoteDayPeriod: Default value is 7. 
    This means that a user can not vote again until 7 days has passed. (we are using cookies)
Test: Default value is 0.
    Set to 1 to not display the percentage bar. Then you as webmaster/admin can vote as
    many times you like (disables the VoteDayPeriod). Please set back to 0 when the 
    percentage bar should be displayed
