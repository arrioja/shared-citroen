MapQuest - Map module
The following module leverages the MapQuest LinkFree web service. 
You can read a description of the service by browsing to 
http://www.mapquest.com/solutions/product.adp?page=linkfree . 
This solution goes beyond the "smart hyperlinking" concept described by 
allowing you to show the actual map on your own site. This is accomplished 
by scraping the URL of the Response to extract the map image link which can 
then be used to display the map image on your site. The solution also builds
a URL which leverages the "Get Directions" functionality of MapQuest (US only -
you must edit file MapQuest.ascx: delete the comments <!-- -->).
