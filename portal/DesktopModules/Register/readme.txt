Current way to add register module (still ok)
- You must place you custom page in DesktopModules\Register folder
- Your custom page must be control named Register<....>.ascx (start with Register word)
- Your control must implement IEditUserProfile interface
- Your control may or may not be compiled with Rainbow (it can be in its own dll)
- On Portalsettings select you control from the menu.

Using custom settings:
- You must register your control as a standard module
- Add it to a page (hidden usually)
- Change your settings
- Record the module number (mid in querystring in property page)
- On Portalsettings fill the Register module ID box with the number.
