Module settings
---------------
This module list data from another Rainbow based portal in a table that looks
similar to the PortalSearch output. Data from the same portal where the module resides
can also be displyed. Various kind of data-filtering, searching and ordering is supported.

To get a quick understanding of how this modules works please add the module to a page
and edit the Module setting (lets pretend you are interrested in localization stuff): 

ServiceItemList Module settings - simple example
------------------------------------------------ 
URL : http://www.rainbowportal.net/
PortalAlias: <Leave this field empty>
LocalMode : Uncheked
Searchstring : localization 
NOTE: just use the default settings of the rest of the fields!
Press OK and see the resulting list of items in a table. The table should list approx. 
9 items: 4 Announcements, 3 articles and 2 HTML Documents.

The layout of the table can be controlled by settings that start with "Show". 
E.g.: Showcreateddate controls if column Date shold be displyed. Ordering is controlled using 
fields Sortfield and SortDirection.

Search tips for field Searchstring:
- Use AND and NOT
- It is not necessary to type AND between words
- Use '-' in front of words. Example:
  "word1 word2 -word3" and "word1 word2 NOT word3" returns same result
- Use ? as singlecharacter wildcart
- OR is not supported (it is ignored)
- Phrase searching supported using quotes: "this is a phrase"
NOTE: The search code PortalSearch uses are called by module ServiceItemList.
