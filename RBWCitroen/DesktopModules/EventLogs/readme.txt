EventLogs - Windows Event viewer

An event viewer that (basically) does the same job as Windows 2000 Event viewer.
The user can control: Machine name, Log type (Application, IExplorer, Security, System) 
and source which depends on the Log type. Sort ascending/descending are provided by 
clicking the table headers.
Note1: You are not allowed to access the Security event log with standard permissions
Note2: This module will slow down the page - much data in the eventlog - have patience
